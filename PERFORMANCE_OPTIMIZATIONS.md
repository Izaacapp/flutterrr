# Performance Optimizations Summary

## Overview
I've implemented several optimizations to fix the overly responsive navigation and reduce jarring transitions in the app.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. **Component Memoization**
- Added `React.memo` to `PostCard` component with custom comparison function
- This prevents unnecessary re-renders when parent components update
- Only re-renders when specific props change (post content, likes, comments)

### 2. **Optimized Feed Component**
- Removed `showToast` dependency from main `useEffect` to prevent re-fetching
- Changed from full API re-fetches to local state updates for:
  - Comment additions
  - Comment deletions
  - Post deletions
  - Like/unlike actions
- Added `useCallback` hooks to memoize event handlers

### 3. **Request Deduplication**
- Created `requestDeduplicator.ts` utility to prevent duplicate API calls
- Implemented 1-second cache for identical requests
- Applied to user profile and search endpoints

### 4. **Search Debouncing**
- Created `debounce.ts` utility for better control
- Increased search debounce delay from 300ms to 500ms
- Memoized search functions to prevent recreations

### 5. **Lazy Loading**
- Implemented code splitting with React.lazy() for all page components
- Added Suspense boundaries with loading indicators
- This reduces initial bundle size and improves load times

### 6. **Console Logging Optimization**
- Wrapped all console.log and console.error statements with:
  ```javascript
  if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
    console.log(...);
  }
  ```
- This completely removes logging in production builds
- Improves performance by eliminating string operations and I/O

### 7. **Transition Improvements**
- Increased route transition duration from 0.15s to 0.2s
- Added loading spinner during lazy component loading
- Created LoadingContext for global loading state management

### 8. **Profile Component Optimization**
- Memoized data fetching functions
- Optimized useEffect dependencies
- Prevented unnecessary API calls when switching tabs

### 9. **Navigation Header Optimization**
- Memoized event handlers
- Improved search result handling
- Added proper cleanup for event listeners

## Results
These optimizations should significantly reduce:
- Duplicate API calls
- Unnecessary component re-renders
- Jarring transitions between routes
- Memory usage from excessive logging
- Initial bundle size through code splitting

The app should now feel more fluid and less "jumpy" when navigating between routes.
