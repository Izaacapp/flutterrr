HOW WE IMPLEMENTED UNIT TESTING AND INTEGRATION TESTING

1. COMPREHENSIVE TEST FRAMEWORK SETUP
   - Backend: Jest with TypeScript (ts-jest) for Node.js testing, configured with coverage reporting
   - Frontend: Vitest with React Testing Library for component and integration tests
   - Mobile: Flutter Test with Mockito for Dart/Flutter testing
   - All environments include proper mocking utilities (fetch, localStorage, WebSocket, etc.)
   - Separate test configurations for unit, integration, and stress testing

2. STRUCTURED TEST ORGANIZATION
   - Clear separation between unit tests (/test/unit/) and integration tests (/test/integration/)
   - Domain-specific test directories for specialized testing (boarding pass validation, OCR correction)
   - Component-based test structure in frontend matching the source code organization
   - Test files colocated with features they test for better maintainability
   - Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases, error scenarios, and performance benchmarks

3. REAL-WORLD SCENARIO TESTING
   - Full system integration tests covering complete user flows (auth → flight creation → social feed)
   - Stress testing with concurrent operations, large datasets, and memory pressure scenarios
   - Network resilience testing including timeouts, retries, and graceful degradation
   - Security testing for SQL injection, XSS attacks, and authentication vulnerabilities
   - Performance benchmarking for critical operations like flight statistics calculation

4. AUTOMATED TESTING PIPELINE
   - Pre-commit hooks ensure tests pass before code commits (Husky + lint-staged)
   - Multiple test scripts for targeted testing (test:unit, test:integration, test:stress)
   - Coverage reporting with multiple formats (lcov, text, HTML) for tracking code coverage
   - Mock services and fixtures for consistent, repeatable test execution
   - Environment-aware testing that adapts to different deployment configurations
